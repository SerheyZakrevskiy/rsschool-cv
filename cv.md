> ###### An ordinary guy from a small village in the Chernihiv region, Ukraine. At the beginning of 2022, I decided myself in programming, I chose to develop websites for myself, and for a year now I have been in this "Fauna". But for now I feel like a victim of the inhabitants. But nothing, soon I will become a predator
